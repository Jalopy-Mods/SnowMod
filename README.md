Explained shortly, this mod makes Jalopy *cold*.
In other words, this mod:
* Changes the atmosphere to a colder one, leaning towards blue and a slightly darker night
* Replaces the rain particles with snow
* Slightly increases the fog
* Replaces all of the textures to a snowy variant (roads turn snowy, grass turns to snow etc)
* Makes the days shorter
* Adds an option to change the handling as if you are driving on snow/ice
* Adds an option to replace the dirt on the car with snowier variants

The snow/ice handling option works very well with the [Better Suspension](https://github.com/Jalopy-Mods/BetterSuspension) mod.

This mod **does not**:
* Replace the rain running down the windscreen with snow
